This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## General overview of what this repo contains

This repo contains a frontend interface built with nextJS and makes use of the following tools:
- [GemFarm](https://github.com/gemworks/gem-farm) for Staking as a Service through a service layer API built by Honey Finance - WIP
- [Honey-SDK](https://github.com/honey-labs/honey-sdk) for permissionless lending pools that use NFTs as collateral - WIP
- [Goki-wallet](https://github.com/GokiProtocol/walletkit) for connecting to Solana wallets
- [degen-ui](https://degen-xyz.vercel.app/) for styling as well as;
- [vanilla-extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/documentation/setup/) for custom CSS code

## Getting Started

First things first,

Make sure to create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file. The RPC_URL is the standard mainnet RPC.
You should replace this with a custom one if you are in need of better performance.
We currently do not have farm listed on devnet, however we will add instructions to add farm to devnet in the future.

Install all the required packages via:

```bash

yarn install

```

Run the development server to test it out:

```bash

yarn dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To test the production server run:

```bash

yarn build

```
